Test text goes here.
Suppose this were long enough to break onto a second line---wouldn't that be grand?
Well, to everyone's delight, it just so happens that it shall!
In fact, if we're very lucky, we might even get to see \emph{three} lines.

\section*{Sections and other divisions}
Not all papers will have sections, of course.
However, if yours does, you should be sure to mark them using \LaTeX{}'s commands for that purpose.
Otherwise, things may end up looking very strange.

\section*{Citation and reference}
A good academic paper should be chock-full of citations.
For example, any \LaTeX{} guide owes a great debt to the \enquote{Not so short introduction to \LaTeXe} \cite{notsoshort}.
